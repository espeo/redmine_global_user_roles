# Global User Roles

### A redmine plugin by Espeo Software.

Allows you to define "global" roles on users, regardless of their projects' membership. That is, roles that are bound to an user, not his membership.

To set user's roles, just edit his account (users#edit).


### Installation

1. Copy this plugin's contents or check out this repository into `/redmine/plugins/espeo_global_user_roles` directory.

2. Run `bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate`.
